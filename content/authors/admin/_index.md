Jeffrey Gorman is a postdoctoral scholar in the BatheBioNano lab at MIT. His research intrests stem from the synthesis of organic semiconductors and challenge of conjugatiing them to DNA, by using solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Leverage DNA nanotechnology he works with DNA origami, a material enabling a large biologically-derived DNA strand, that can be folded into 2-3D structures by programmed hybridization with short, artifical DNA complements. Here he assembles DNA into objects hundreds of nanometers long, and by attach semiconductors to DNA he assembles these photoactive cargo too.

Jeffrey Gorman completed his PhD in the Optoelectronics Group at Cambridge under the supervision of Prof. Sir Richard Friend, where he develop the synthetic methodology to overcome the mutual insolubility of large, aromatic semiconductors and DNA using solid phase chemsitry. This work allowed the generation of semiconductor-DNA chimeras, facilitating the study of  ultrafast photophysics for singlet fission and charge-transfer in precisly defined oligomers.

He completed his undergraduate and masters in Chemsitry and Imperial College London, under the Lawrence Burrow Trust fellowship, and awarded the Dean's list for top 5 highest graded students in his final year. His Master thesis and year in industry (Merck KGaA) focused on device fabrication and polymer chemistry for organic solar cells.
