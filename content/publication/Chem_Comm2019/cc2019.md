abstract: Artificial light harvesters require ordered arrangement of chromophores. We covalently attach three organic chromophore ligands to silicon dioxide nanoparticles. This allows us to study inter-ligand energy transfer when attached to SiO2 nanoparticles, creating a simple system with a large ratio of donors to acceptors. Using steady-state and transient spectroscopy measurements we quantify this energy transfer between ligands. We show a maximum transfer efficiency of 30% and measure the 2D diffusion length of anthracene carboxylic acid on SiO2 to be between 0.6 and 2.2 nm.
