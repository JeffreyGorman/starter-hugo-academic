abstract: "The creation of light-harvesting antenna complexes offers numerous potential applications in the field of optoelectronics. Cesium lead halide nanocrystals, specifically, are beginning to show great promise for optoelectronic applications due to their thermal stability and bright luminescence. As per the majority of all colloidally stable nanocrystals, they process surface-bound ligands that offer stability and surface state passivation. By replacing these ligands with organic chromophores various energy interactions can be observed, leading to a greater variety of potential applications. In this paper, we show enhanced emission in red and orange perylene diimide organic dye ligands through the transfer of energy harvested by CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. This has been demonstrated via steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements and has a great potential for spectral management through energy-transfer interactions in hybrid light-harvesting systems. We estimate the Förster resonance energy-transfer efficiencies of up to 65 and 45% for perylene orange ligand surface loadings and perylene red ligand surface loadings respectively."
